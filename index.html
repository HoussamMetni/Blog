							<h1><font color="Purple" style="font-family:'Parisienne', cursive;"> My experience at the E-nitiate Camp </font></h1>
							<p> <font color="White" style="font-family: 'Slabo 27px', serif;"> My name is Houssam Metni. I am 17 years old, from Tetouan, Morocco. I got the chance to participate in the first edition of the E-nitiate Camp at wonderful AUI. This is a static website made as part of the first Web-Development project, containing information about myself and my experience, as well as my contact information.  </p>
							<p>I found out about E-nitiate by pure chance when I was on Facebook (see it's not only a waste of time :) ).
							I applied to it since I am very interested in programming, as I had taken a C++ class during my exchange. It was an easy application process: all I needed for the first round was to complete an online form. I enjoyed answering the question, and submitted it. After a few days, I was e-mailed for an interview. Only 40 out of 262 applicants were selected, and I was only one step away from achieving my dream. When I did the interview, I felt like I said everything that the team should know about me, and fortunately I wasn't disappointed.

									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p> <br>
									 I am a 17 year old outgoing guy from Tetouan. I'm graduating high school next year, after 12 years of Moroccan Education and an exchange year with the Kennedy Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program in the US. I have a wide range of interest that include but are not limited to: science, math, computer science, debate, international relations and politics. Having so many interests only makes it harder for me to make my career choices :) </br>
									 <br> E-nitiate was organised by generous alumni of the YES program willing to make change in their country, with the help of the US department of State through the Alumni Engagement Innovation Fund (AEIF). Below are more information about the YES program. </br>

									<h2>My experience at E-nitiate</h2>
									
									<p> <br> A few days ago when I got to the camp, I didn't know what to expect. I only knew one person who got in. However, it only took me one day to get to know everyone else. My favorite thing about the camp so far is the atmosphere. E-nitiators have become a family, and I really enjoy working on projects and sharing our passion together, as well as the fun moments we spend at night after a busy day of classes. I am inspired by everyone in the camp; from participants to professors to volunteers. I am looking forward to using what I learned to develop my programming skills, and hopefully create a debate platform so that anyone can get to express themselves freely without constraints. </br> </p>
